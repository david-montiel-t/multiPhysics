<B>What is PRISMS-MultiPhysics?</B>

  PRISMS-MultiPhysics (PRISMS-MP) is an open-source, high-performance framework that concurrently couples the phase-field (PF) and crystal plasticity (CP) models to simulate microstructure evolution. In this framework, which combines classes and methods from PRISMS-PF and PRISMS-Plasticity, PF and CP fields are defined on separate finite element meshes with different refinement levels, and relevant fields are transferred throughout the time evolution.

  This code is developed by the PRedictive Integrated Structural
  Materials Science (PRISMS) Center [http://www.prisms-center.org/]
  at University of Michigan which is supported by the U.S. Department
  of Energy (DOE), Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences
  and Engineering under Award #DE-SC0008637. 

  PRISMS-MP is build on top of the [deal.II](http://www.dealii.org) open source finite element library. The latest supported version is [9.5.2](https://dealii.org/9.5.0/index.html).

  deal.ii needs to be built with the petsc and p4est dependencies and without the trilinos package. To do that, if you're using candi, you can turn it off in candi.cfg by commenting that as #PACKAGES="${PACKAGES} once:trilinos". With deal.ii installed and $DEAL_II_DIR setup, the following steps can be followed to download and compile the code

<!--<B>Installation:</B>
  Refer to the installation manual in docs/installation/ manual.pdf (under development) for detailed instructions on getting started with using the plasticity code.-->

  Clone the PRISMS-MultiPhysics GitHub repo
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/prisms-center/multiPhysics.git
  ```
  Go to the directory ```multiPhysics``` 
  ```
  $ cd multiPhysics
  ```
  Compile the core library by typing
  ```
  $ cmake .
  ```
  followed by
  ```
  $ make -j <nprocs>
  ```
  where \<nprocs> refers to number the number of processors used for compilation. Using with more than one processor alloys for parallel (and faster) compilation.

  Compile an application (e.g. singleTwin3D)
  ```
  $ cd applications/singleTwin3D
  ```
  ```
  $ cmake . <br>
  ```
  ```
  $ make -j <nprocs> release 
  ```
  Run the executable (main) with the CP and PF parameters files as arguments:
  ```
  $ mpirun -n <nprocs> parameters_cp.prm parameters_pf.prm
  ```
 
  Updates: Since PRISMS-MP code is still under active development, regular code and documentation updates are pushed to the upstream repo (https://github.com/prisms-center/multiPhysics) and we strongly
  recommend users to synchronize their respective clones forks regularly.

<B>Visualization</B>

  Output of the primal fields and postprocessed fields is in standard vtk
  format (*.vtu files) which can be visualized with the
  following open source applications:
  + VisIt (https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/downloads)
  + Paraview (http://www.paraview.org/download/)

<!--
<B>Getting started:</B>

  Examples of various boundary value problems are located under the
  applications/ folder. Easiest way to get started on the code is to
  run the applications.

  Applications are intended to serve as (1) Demonstration of the
  capabilities of this library, (2) Provide a framework for
  further development of specialized/advanced applications by
  users.

  Application or code under development/testing is preceded by an
  underscore.

  List of folders:
  + src/: material models (continuum plasticity and crystal plasticity),
  ellipticBVP (base class for parallel implementation of elliptic
  boundary value problems), enrichment models (enhanced strain),
  utility (static condensation class, crystal orientations and grain
  information IO)
  + applications/: continuum plasticity and crystal plasticity
  + utils/: IntegrationTools (developed by the PRISMS center and available at
  https://github.com/prisms-center/IntegrationTools) and json headers
  + docs/: Installation Manual, User manual, and User defined material model manual
  + Training_Materials/: Instructions for using preprocessing tools, such as generating input files, and postprocessing tools, such as visualizing the outputs
  + html/: HTML documentation generated by doxygen

<B>Documentation:</B>

  Detailed Installation Manual, User manual, and User defined material model manual are provided in /doc/ folder.
